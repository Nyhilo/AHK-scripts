Auto Hotkey scripts that I use regularly.

## Persistent Generic Controls

* `F13` key translates to `prnt scr` for when I'm using a [wired mac keyboard](https://imgur.com/2aPOniB) on Windows
* `ctr`+`alt`+`u`, `ctr`+`alt`+`l`, and `ctr`+`alt`+`k` for making a selected chunk of text UPPERCASE,
    lowercase and Title Case respectively
* Keyboard shortcut `@shrug` that changes to ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ when typed out.
* `ctr`+`alt`+`t` pins the currently active window to be the top-most window.
    Doing the shortcut again unpins it
* Taskbar volume and music control. Scrolling while hovering the mouse over the task bar will adjust volume up and down.
    Middle-clicking on the taskbar will pause and play your music.
    
## Esperanto
* Replaces the x-style esperanto digraphs into their proper hatted forms.
    For example `Cxu gxis` becomes `Ĉu ĝis`
