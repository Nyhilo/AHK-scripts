Auto Hotkey scripts that I use regularly.

## Persistent Generic Controls

* `F13` key translates to `prnt scr` for when I'm using a [wired mac keyboard](https://imgur.com/2aPOniB) on Windows
* `ctr`+`alt`+`u`, `ctr`+`alt`+`l`, and `ctr`+`alt`+`k` for making a selected chunk of text UPPERCASE,
    lowercase and Title Case respectively
* Keyboard shortcut `@shrug` that changes to ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ when typed out.
* `ctr`+`alt`+`t` pins the currently active window to be the top-most window.
    Doing the shortcut again unpins it
* Taskbar volume and music control. Scrolling while hovering the mouse over the task bar will adjust volume up and down.
    Middle-clicking on the taskbar will pause and play your music.
    
## Esperanto
* Replaces the x-style esperanto digraphs into their proper hatted forms.
    For example `Cxu gxis` becomes `Ĉu ĝis`

## Colemak Caps Commands
Normally I use a mechanical keyboard with a bunch of convenient navigational keys, using capslock as the `fn` key. This emulates some of that functionality for machines where I don't have access to a custom hardware keyboard.

Primarily, this sets  the following:
* `fn + u,n,e,i` to arrow keys (`i,j,k,l` on a qwerty keyboard)
* `fn+l` and `fn+y` as page up and page down
* `fn+space` for shift
* `fn+c` for ctrl
* `fn+z` for the menu button (right-click)
* `fn+b` as \` and ~
* `fn+a` as Home and both `fn+o` and `fn+'` as End

Seriously, put your pinkey on capslock, index on `c`, and your thumb on space and imagine navigating and highlighting by full words with ijkl. It's really nice.
